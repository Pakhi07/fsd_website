When evaluating **continual learning** models, it's important to use a set of metrics that assess both the model's performance on new tasks and its ability to retain knowledge of previous tasks. Here are the most commonly used metrics in continual learning, along with explanations for each:

### 1. **Average Accuracy (ACC)**
   - It is the average classification accuracy over all tasks after training is completed.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \text{ACC} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_{i,n}
     \]
     Where:
     - \( A_{i,n} \) is the accuracy on task \( i \) after learning task \( n \),
     - \( n \) is the total number of tasks.
   - **Purpose**: Measures how well the model performs on all tasks after learning the final task. It captures both the model's performance on new tasks and its ability to retain prior knowledge.

### 2. **Forgetting (F)**
   - **Definition**: The amount of performance drop (forgetting) on previous tasks after learning new tasks.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \text{F} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \left( A_{i,i} - A_{i,n} \right)
     \]
     Where:
     - \( A_{i,i} \) is the accuracy on task \( i \) immediately after learning task \( i \),
     - \( A_{i,n} \) is the accuracy on task \( i \) after learning task \( n \).
   - **Purpose**: Quantifies how much knowledge is lost from previous tasks when a new task is learned. A lower value indicates better retention of knowledge from earlier tasks.

<!-- ### 3. **Forward Transfer (FT)**
   - **Definition**: Measures how well learning previous tasks helps improve the performance on new tasks.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \text{FT} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=2}^{n} \left( A_{i,i} - A_{\text{random}} \right)
     \]
     Where:
     - \( A_{i,i} \) is the accuracy on task \( i \) immediately after learning task \( i \),
     - \( A_{\text{random}} \) is the accuracy of a randomly initialized model on task \( i \).
   <!-- - **Purpose**: Captures the ability of the model to transfer knowledge from earlier tasks to improve the learning of new tasks. -->
<!-- 
### 4. **Backward Transfer (BWT)**
   - **Definition**: Measures how learning new tasks affects the performance on previously learned tasks.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \text{BWT} = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \left( A_{i,n} - A_{i,i} \right)
     \]
     Where:
     - \( A_{i,n} \) is the accuracy on task \( i \) after learning task \( n \),
     - \( A_{i,i} \) is the accuracy on task \( i \) immediately after learning task \( i \).
   - **Purpose**: Captures the impact of new task learning on past task performance. Positive backward transfer is rare, but a less negative value indicates better preservation of earlier knowledge. -->

### 5. **Task Accuracy Retention (TAR)**
   - **Definition**: Measures the proportion of accuracy retained after learning new tasks.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \text{TAR} = \frac{A_{i,n}}{A_{i,i}}
     \]
     Where:
     - \( A_{i,n} \) is the accuracy on task \( i \) after learning task \( n \),
     - \( A_{i,i} \) is the accuracy on task \( i \) after learning task \( i \).
   - **Purpose**: Provides a measure of how well the model retains the ability to perform earlier tasks. A value close to 1 indicates excellent retention.
<!--    
### 6. **Transfer Efficiency (TE)**
   - **Definition**: Measures how effectively the model transfers knowledge between tasks in a continual learning setting.
   - **Purpose**: It’s used when tasks are related, and the model is expected to leverage previously learned representations to learn new tasks faster and more efficiently. -->

### 7. **Time to Stability**
   - **Definition**: Measures how quickly a model stabilizes after learning a new task. It captures the number of epochs or iterations before the model’s performance on a task no longer changes significantly.
   - **Purpose**: Helps to quantify how fast the model adapts to a new task without destabilizing previously learned knowledge.
<!-- 
### 8. **Memory Usage**
   - **Definition**: The amount of memory (e.g., number of parameters, storage of exemplars, or other resources) consumed by the model.
   - **Purpose**: In continual learning scenarios, it’s important to assess how much additional memory is required to avoid catastrophic forgetting. Models that use fewer resources are preferred.

### 9. **Training Time**
   - **Definition**: The time it takes to train the model on all tasks.
   - **Purpose**: Measuring training time is essential to understand the computational cost of mitigating catastrophic forgetting in continual learning. -->

### 10. **Gradient Stability**
   - **Definition**: Tracks how stable the gradients are over time as new tasks are introduced. It helps to analyze whether the gradients become unstable, which might indicate catastrophic forgetting.
   - **Purpose**: Useful for methods that regularize gradients (e.g., Elastic Weight Consolidation) to prevent forgetting.

### Example of How to Use These Metrics in Your Experiments:

- **Average Accuracy (ACC)**: Report the model’s accuracy on each task at the end of training. This helps you understand the overall performance across tasks.
  
- **Forgetting (F)**: Calculate how much the accuracy drops for earlier tasks after learning new tasks. This will show how well your method prevents catastrophic forgetting.

- **Forward Transfer (FT)** and **Backward Transfer (BWT)**: Measure whether learning new tasks helps or harms the performance on previous or future tasks.

- **Task Accuracy Retention (TAR)**: Measure how much accuracy is retained on earlier tasks after new task training. This directly shows the impact of neuron freezing and Hebbian learning in preserving task-specific knowledge.

- **Memory Usage** and **Training Time**: Highlight how resource-efficient your model is, especially if selective freezing reduces memory usage and speeds up training.

By using these metrics, you can provide a comprehensive evaluation of your model’s ability to handle continual learning.
